        <p>It's that time of the year again. <a href="http://open.spotify.com/">Spotify</a> Wrapped is ready. Are you?</p>
        <p>Life moves at the lights' speed and we're already at the end of the year, luckily Spotify took notes of my favourite jams.</p>

        <h2>Top Song</h2>
        <p>I played <strong>8 018</strong> songs this year. However, there's one song on top of my list which I played over, and over, and over again...</p>
        <h3>HERMÈS by DJ Clen featuring A-Reece, Maraza and Jay Jody</h3>
        <img src="/media/hermes.jpg" alt="DJ Clen's HERMÈS cover for single release featuring A-Reece, Maraza and Jay Jody">
        <p>The reason why for this song was on repeat when it dropped is because I remember hearing it for the first time at Reece Effect in April 2024 and was performing live for the first time by the artists. Funny enough, which is not funny though, I watched the performance immediately after they stole my phone from me through pickpocketing tricks. I had a great day beside the downside of losing my phone.</p>
        <p>I streamed the song <strong>46 times</strong> starting on 10 May</p>
        <p>Nostalgia never sounded so good.</p>
        <h3>While it's not a competition... here's the leaderboard for my top 5 most played songs</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>HERMÈS - DJ Clen featuring A-Reece, Maraza and Jay Jody</li>
